# **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Guide for Robinhood**

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is an essential security feature that protects your accounts from unauthorized access. When integrated with platforms like Cryptopilot, it ensures that your financial data remains secure. Here's a step-by-step guide to set up and use 2FA with Robinhood using an authenticator app.

## **How 2FA Works with Robinhood**:

1. **Device Approvals**: Upon logging in from a new device, notifications are sent to all approved devices for the user to approve or block the activity.
2. **Authenticator App**: An authenticator app generates a code that Robinhood requires for login.
3. **Text Message (SMS)**: A one-time code is dispatched to the user's mobile device via SMS.

*Note: If using FaceID, a verification code is necessary when logging into the Robinhood website.*

## **Setting Up 2FA Using an Authenticator App**:

1. **Download an Authenticator App**: Robinhood is compatible with major third-party authenticator apps. Some popular options include:
   - Authy
   - Duo Mobile
   - Google Authenticator
   - Microsoft Authenticator

2. **Enable 2FA in Robinhood**:
   - Launch the Robinhood app and select your profile picture in the bottom right corner.
   - Access the menu in the top right corner or the settings option.
   - Navigate to "Security and privacy" > "Two-factor authentication".
   - Pick your desired authenticator app.
   - Click on "Open app" to transfer the key to your authenticator app.
   - Duplicate the secret key presented.
   - Launch your authenticator app and choose to add a new account.
   - Click "Manually enter account setup key" and paste the secret key from Robinhood.
   - Assign a name to the account (e.g., Robinhood) and confirm.

3. **Using 2FA**:
   - When prompted in the Robinhood app, type in the verification code generated by your authenticator app. Remember, the validity window for the code is limited.

4. **Backup Codes**:
   - During 2FA setup, Robinhood will provide backup codes. Store these securely, either digitally or physically, for use in case of lost device access.

#### **Important Notes**:
- Ensure the time on your authenticator app is synchronized. Time discrepancies can invalidate TOTP codes.
- Safeguard your secret key and backup codes; never share them.
- Use backup codes to access your Robinhood account if you lose access to your authenticator app.
